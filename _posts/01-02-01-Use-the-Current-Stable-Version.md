## Use the Current Stable Version (5.4)

If you are just getting started with PHP make sure to start with the current stable release of [PHP 5.4][php-release]. PHP has made great strides adding powerful [new features](#language_highlights) over the last few years. Don't let the minor version number difference between 5.2 and 5.4 fool you, it represents _major_ improvements.
