## Windows Setup

Installing PHP on windows means downloading the zip file, unzipping and dropping the resulting directory into place - c:\program files\php or c:\php are popular locations.

For learning and local development, use the built in webserver with PHP 5.4
If you need a webserver IIS7 will give you the most stable and best performance on Windows.  You can use phpmanager (a gui plugin for IIS7) to make configuring and managing PHP simple. IIS7 comes with fastcgi built in and ready to go, you just need to configure PHP as a handler.

If you need more then just PHP, the Web Platform Installer from Microsoft will help get you set up quickly.

For support and additional resources there is a dedicated area on iis.net for PHP.
