## Mac Setup

OS X comes prepackaged with PHP. As of Mountain Lion, it is _not_ the current stable version of PHP, though. 
You can get the PHP executable through a number of Mac [package managers][mac-package-managers] or [compile it yourself][mac-compile] (if compiling, be sure to have Xcode installed, or Apple's substitute ["Command Line Tools for Xcode" downloadable from Apple's Mac Developer Center][apple-developer]). 
For a complete LAMP package with GUI try [MAMP2][mamp-downloads], otherwise consider [Entropy 5.4 package][entropy-downloads].
