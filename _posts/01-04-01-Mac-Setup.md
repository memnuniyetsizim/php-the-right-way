## Mac Setup

OSX comes prepackaged with PHP but it is normally a little behind the latest stable. Lion comes with PHP 5.3.6 and Mountain Lion has 5.3.10.

To update PHP on OSX you can get the PHP executable through a number of Mac [package managers][mac-package-managers] or [compile it yourself][mac-compile] (if compiling, be sure to have installed either Xcode or Apple's substitute ["Command Line Tools for Xcode" downloadable from Apple's Mac Developer Center][apple-developer]). 

For a complete LAMP package with GUI try [MAMP][mamp-downloads], otherwise consider the [Entropy 5.4][entropy-downloads] package.
