# Application Design Patterns

There are numerous ways to structure your web applications, and you can put as much or as little thought as you like
into architecting your code. But it is usually a good idea to follow to one of the common patterns because it will make
your code easier to manage and easier for others to understand.

The most common patterns used in PHP development today are the front controller pattern and the MVC pattern (and its
relatives).

## Front Controller

The front controller pattern is where you have a single entrance point for you web application (e.g. index.php) that
handles all of the requests. This code is responsible for loading all of the dependencies, processing the request and
sending the response to the browser. The front controller pattern can be beneficial because it encourages modular code
and gives you a central place to hook in code that should be run for every request (such as input sanitization).

## Model-View-Controller

The model-view-controller (MVC) pattern and its relatives HMVC and MVVM let you break up code into logical objects that
serve very specific purposes. Models serve as a data access layer where data it fetched and returned in formats usable
throughout your application. Controllers handle the request, process the data returned from models and load views to
send in the response. And views are display templates (markup, xml, etc) that are sent in the response to the web
browser.

MVC is the most common pattern used in the popular [PHP frameworks](https://github.com/codeguy/php-the-right-way/wiki/Frameworks).
