# Introduction

There's a lot of bad information on the Web (I'm looking at you, W3Schools) that leads new PHP users astray, propagating bad practices and bad code. This must stop. _PHP: The Right Way_ easy-to-read, quick reference for PHP best practices, accepted coding standards, and links to authoritative tutorials around the Web.

It is important to understand _there is no canonical way to use PHP_. That's the beauty of it. This website introduces new PHP developers to best practices, available options, and good information.
