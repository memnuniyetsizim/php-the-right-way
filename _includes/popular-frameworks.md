# Popular Frameworks

Rather than re-invent the wheel, many PHP developers use _frameworks_ to build out web applications. Frameworks abstract away many of the low-level concerns and provide helpful, easy-to-use interfaces to complete common tasks.

_You do not need to use a framework for every project_. Sometimes, plain PHP is the right way to go. But if you do need a framework, here are a few of the most popular ones:

## Full-Stack Frameworks
