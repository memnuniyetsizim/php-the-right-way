# Testing

Writing automated tests for your PHP code is considered a best practice and can lead to well-built
applications. Automated tests are a great tool for making sure your application
does not break when you are making changes or adding new functionality.

Some common tools are:

* [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de) is the dominant [unit-testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) framework used
by PHP developers
* [Behat](http://behat.org) is testing framework for those who prefer to 
use [Behaviour Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour-driven_development) to
test their applications
* [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/) is a tool that can automate browser usage
for testing purposes
