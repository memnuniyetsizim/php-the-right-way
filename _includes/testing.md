# Testing

Writing automated tests for your PHP code is considered a best practice and can lead to well-built
applications. Automated tests are a great tool for making sure your application
does not break when you are making changes or adding new functionality.

Some common tools are:

* [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de)
* [Behat](http://behat.org)
* [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/)
