# Code Style Guide

The PHP community is large and diverse, composed of innumerable libraries, frameworks, and components. It is common for PHP developers to choose several of these and combine them into a single project. Is is important that PHP code adhere (as close as possible) to a common code style to make it easy for developers to mix and match various libraries for their projects.

The [Framework Interop Group][1] (a.k.a. PHP Standards Group) has proposed and approved a code style standard — [PSR-1][2] and [PSR-2][3]. Don't let the funny names confuse you. These two standards are merely a "shared set of rules and expectations about how to format PHP code." That's all.

You should write PHP code that adheres to one or both of these standards so that other developers can easily read and work with your code.
