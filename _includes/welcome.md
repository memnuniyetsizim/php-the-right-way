# Welcome

There's a lot of outdated information on the Web that leads new PHP users astray, propagating bad practices and bad
code. This must stop. _PHP: The Right Way_ is an easy-to-read, quick reference for PHP best practices, accepted coding 
standards, and links to authoritative tutorials around the Web.

## Disclaimer

_There is no canonical way to use PHP_. However, this website is a humble display of some of the best practices,
available options, and good information. It aims to introduce new PHP developers and to rethink seasoned pros with fresh
ideas.

This is a living document and will continue to be updated with more helpful information and examples as they become
available.
