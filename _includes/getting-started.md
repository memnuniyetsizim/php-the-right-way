# Getting Started

## Use the Current Stable Version (5.4)

If you are just getting started with PHP make sure to start with the current stable release of [PHP 5.4][php-release]. PHP has made great strides adding powerful [new features](#language_highlights) over the last few years. Don't let the minor version number difference between 5.2 and 5.4 fool you, it represents _major_ improvements.

## Built-in web server

You can start learning PHP without the hassle of installing and configuring a full-fledged web server (PHP 5.4 required). To start the server, run the following from your terminal in your project's web root:

    > php -S localhost:8000

## Mac Setup

OS X comes prepackaged with PHP. As of Mountain Lion, it is _not_ the current stable version of PHP, though. You can get the PHP executable through a number of Mac [package managers][mac-package-managers] or [compile it yourself][mac-compile] (if compiling, be sure to have Xcode installed, or Apple's substitute ["Command Line Tools for Xcode" downloadable from Apple Developer][apple-developer]). For a complete Apache, MySQL, and PHP installation check out [MAMP2][mamp-downloads].

## Windows Setup

You can install PHP on windows from an install executable found on the official [PHP Downloads][php-downloads] page. For a complete Apache, MySQL, and PHP installation check out [WAMP][wamp-installer].
