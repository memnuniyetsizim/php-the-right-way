# Language Highlights

## Programming Paradigms

PHP is a flexible, dynamic language that supports a variety of programming techniques. It has evolved dramatically over the years, notably adding a solid object-oriented model in PHP 5.0 (2004), anonymous functions and namespaces in PHP 5.3 (2009), and traits in PHP 5.4 (2012).

## Namespaces

As mentioned above, the PHP community has a lot of developers creating lots of code. This means that one library's PHP code may use the same class name as another library. When both libraries are used in the same namespace, they collide and cause trouble.

_Namespaces_ solve this problem. As described in the PHP reference manual, namespaces may be compared to operating system directories that _namespace_ files; two files with the same name may co-exist in separate directories. Likewise, two PHP classes with the same name may co-exist in separate PHP namespaces. It's as simple as that.

It is important for you to namespace your code so that it may be used by other developers without fear of colliding with other libraries.

## Standard PHP Library

The Standard PHP Library (SPL) is packaged with PHP and provides a collection of classes and interfaces. It is made up primarily of commonly needed datastructure classes (stack, queue, heap, and so on), and iterators which can traverse over these datastructures or your own classes which implement SPL interfaces.

## Command Line Interface

PHP was created primarily to write web applications, but it's also useful for scripting command line interface (CLI) programs, too. Command line PHP programs can help you automate common tasks like testing, deployment, and application administrativia.

CLI PHP programs are powerful because you can use your app's code directly without having to create and secure a web GUI for it. Just be sure not to put your CLI PHP scripts in your public web root!

Try running PHP from your command line:

    > php -i

The `-i` option will print your PHP configuration just like the [`phpinfo`][phpinfo] function. There are a number of other useful [command line options][cli-options], too.

Let's write a simple "Hello, $name" CLI program. To try it out, create a file named `hello.php`, as below.

    <?php
    if($argc != 2) {
        die("Usage: php hello.php [name].\n");
    }
    $name = $argv[1];
    echo "Hello, $name\n";

PHP sets up two special variables based on the arguments your script is run with. [`$argc`][argc] is an integer variable containing the argument *count* and [`$argv`][argv] is an array variable containing each argument's *value*. The first argument is always the name of your PHP script file, in this case `hello.php`.

To run our script, above, from the command line:

    > php hello.php
    Usage: php hello.php [name]
    > php hello.php world
    Hello, world

### Built-in, command line web server

Starting with PHP 5.4, you can develop locally on a PHP-enabled web server without the hassle of installing and configuring a full-fledged web server. To start the server, from your web root:

    > php -S localhost:8000
